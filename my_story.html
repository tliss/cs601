                <h3>My undergrad years</h3>
                <p>In 2005, I attended the <strong>University of Massachusetts: Dartmouth</strong> to enroll in their B.S. Computer Science degree. 
                    Due to some difficulties with the coursework, I ended up switching majors and pursued a B.A. in History and Sociology-Anthropolgy.
                    This gave me the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Beijing, China so that I could puruse one of my interests which is
                    Chinese history and culture. As a child, I grew up in a very Chinese neighborhood and had a lot of Chinese friends. I wanted to
                    learn more about China and the best way for me to do what was first hand by visiting the country.</p>

                <p>I graduated from UMass: Dartmouth in 2010 and was offered a scholarship to study abroad in Chongqing, China. I was able to spend a year
                    studying Chinese at <strong>Chongqing University</strong>. It was during my time at <abbr title="Chongqing University">CQU</abbr> 
                    that I me my wife. In addition to learning Chinese, I also got a taste for teaching English. I found out that I had a natural knack for 
                    presenting and this would become important to me once I arrived back in the United States.</p>

                <h3>My time as an <abbr title="English as a Second Language">ESL</abbr> Teacher</h3>
                <p>Upon arriving back in the United States, I had trouble finding a job. In addition to the United States still recovering from the 2008 
                    financial crisis, it turns out that there aren't a lot of positions available for someone with a degree in history and anthropology. 
                    I decided to go back to school and after discussing it with my then-girlfriend, chose to pursue a M.Ed. degree in 
                    <abbr title="Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages">TESOL</abbr> at Boston University. I finished my degree in 2013 and was 
                    offered a position as a lead teacher at the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. I taught English at 
                    <abbr title="Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center">BCNC</abbr> for three years. During that time, I decided to marry my girlfriend from 
                    China, and she came to live with me in the US.</p>

                <h3>My time as a computer science student</h3>
                <p>After teaching <abbr title="English as a Second Language">ESL</abbr> for 3 years, I was starting to get burnt out. Although I was good
                    at it, it wasn't brinign me the sort of joy that I hoped for in a career. After some intense soul-searching, I started to re-pursue my
                    interest in computer science. I started learning programming on my own, and eventually <a href="https://github.com/tliss/ECFBB">created an application</a> 
                    for my school that helped teachers prepare their lesson plans. Inspired by this success, I applied for Oregon State University's
                    online B.S. Comptuer Science post-baccalaureate program. I was accepted into the program, and after my first few semesters I started applying 
                    for internships to get my foot in the door. I got extremely lucky and landed my first job at Monster Worldwide Inc. as an associate
                    release engineer.</p>

                <figure>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/monster.jpg" alt="Me at Monster in 2016">
                        <figcaption>Me at Monster in 2016</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>

                <p>I stayed on with Monster for a little over a year, before I sought out my next job. I didn't want to become pigeon-holed into a release 
                    engineering role, so I found a new job at another company in 2017 as an associate software developer. Unfortunately, that job didn't last too
                    long and due to some economic troubles, I was laid off in 2018. In 2019 I wound up at my current position working as a junior developre for KBR, Inc.
                    and I have been with them for over a year now. I work in Cambridge at the <strong>John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center</strong> and am doing
                    a lot of interesting work for the government now.</p>
                    
                <figure>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/kbr.jpg" alt="Me at the Volpe Center in 2019">
                        <figcaption>Me at the Volpe Center in 2019</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>

                <p>After starting with KBR, I decided to leave <abbr title="Oregon State University">OSU</abbr>'s program 
                    and switch instead to Boston University's M.S. in Computer Science program. My reason for doing so was three-fold:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The time and money investment would be the same, so it is better to end up with a master's degree than a bachelor's</li>
                    <li>I had previously attended BU for another master's degree and was well aware of the quality of their programs</li>
                    <li>I had been taking online courses at <abbr title="Oregon State University">OSU</abbr> and felt I was missing out on a lot by not having an in-classroom experience</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even though I was about halfway done with <abbr title="Oregon State University">OSU</abbr>'s program. I still felt I made the right choice. So that's where 
                I am today. I am working full time, happily married, and purusing a degree in a subject I wish I had pursued very long ago!</p>
