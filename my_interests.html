                <h3 id="chinese">Chinese history and culture</h3>

                <p>I grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts which has a very high percentage of Chinese-Americans for its population. I have always been
                    interested in Chinese history and culture and love to share what I have learned with people whenever possible. </p>
                
                <p>Here is one of the first Chinese songs I liked when I started studying Chinese. It's called <cite>Full Bloom of Life</cite>
                    by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Feng_(singer)">Wang Feng</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="capoeira">Capoeira</h3>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">Capoeira</a> is an afro-brazilian martial art and dance. It has a lot of its roots buried in the history of 
                slavery in Brazil and is as much a spiritual activity as it is a physical activity. I started learning capoeira when I began studying at UMass: Dartmouth. I 
                took a ten-year hiatus after graduating, but recently started learning again thanks to a school in the boston area called 
                <a href="http://sinhacapoeira.com/">Sinha Capoeira</a>.</p>
